# d3-front-end

### Getting started

Todo list is in todos.md.

There are no dependencies except d3 which is referenced in the html.

```bash
open index.html  ## opens with google chrome, etc
```

Open index.html with a browser and it will load. There's no backend needed.
(If you want live-reload, run live-reload.js.)
